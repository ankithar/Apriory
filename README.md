# Apriory and SON algorithm
Implementation of Apriory algorithm to find frequent itemsets and SON algorithm to apply Apriory on the 20 million MovieLens dataset.

- SON algorithm processes chunks of data from the data files in order to identify frequent datasets. 
- Apriory algorithm is used to process data and find frequent itemsets in each data chunk.
- The algorithm runs on 3 datasets. The small data set has been attached under TesData folder. The other datasets are ml-latest-small.zip and ml-20m.zip, and can be found here- https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
- The support thresholds and execution time constraints are mentioned in the description files.
